# Computer-Vision-Projects

#### This repository showcases my Computer Vision projects, demonstrating my skills in image and video analysis, object detection, and machine learning. The projects cover a range of topics, including:
* Object Detection (face detection, pedestrian detection, object tracking)
* Image Segmentation (image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation)
* Image Processing (image filtering, image restoration, image enhancement)

#### Each project includes:
* A brief description of the problem and approach
* Code in Python, using popular libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
* Results, including visualizations and insights

#### My goal is to share my work, provide context, and demonstrate my ability to:
* Preprocess and analyze image and video data
* Develop predictive models for object detection and image classification
* Extract insights and meaning from visual data
I hope you find my Computer Vision portfolio informative and inspiring! Explore the projects to see my approach and results.
